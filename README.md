This is the first assignment for the course: Exploratory Data Analysis

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. 
The task is to reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.

What I did:
Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
Create a separate R code file plot1, plot2.R, etc.that constructs the corresponding plot.
The code file includes code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced.
